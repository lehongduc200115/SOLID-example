Problem statements:
- Succesful software will need to be changed and developed. Software complexity is increased during changes. Without good coding principles, software will become a mess and soon cannot continue developing. That is where SOLID come into play.

What is SOLID?
- SOLID is a set of design principles. There are 5 keys principle in solid:
1. Single Responsibility Principle
2. Open-Closed Principle
3. Liskov Substitution Principle
4. Interface Segregation Principle
5. Dependency Inversion Principle
SOLID affects directly in one of the four pillars: maintainability.

We will come through each principle in this source code.
There are 3 files in each folder:
1. _description: Including problem statement and how to resolve.
2. bad.ts: Bad coding practice that violate the principle.
3. good.ts: Good coding practice that fully obey the principle.

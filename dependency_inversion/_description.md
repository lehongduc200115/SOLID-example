Problem statements:
- A class is strongly depended on specific class is not good. Moreover, coding flexibility in substituting those dependencies is low, that lead to harder in maintaining codes, and higher in decoupling, which is not good in programming. 

Dependency Inversion Principle:
- Decoupling a software modules. Concretely, using abstraction instread of specifically depend on specific class.

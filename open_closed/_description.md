Problem statements:
- A class that need to be modified when somethings added. This modification may lead to some un-awared bugs and problems. Instead of changing the class, we may extend it (this can be done easily by good-designed code and inheritance, polymorphism principle of OOP).

Open-Closed Principle:
- "Opened for extension, closed for modification".
